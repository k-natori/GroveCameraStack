# GroveCameraStack

GroveCameraStack is a skecth to transfer captured image from M5Camera to M5Stack, using Grove connectors and cable with UART.
Please see counterparts of this skecth for M5Camera:

https://github.com/k-natori/GroveCamera

These sketches written for M5Camera X and M5Stack Basic, so should be modified for your devices. For example, you should specify M5Camera model in "define" section, should change RX and TX pins for other M5Stack models.

A schematic diagram of the cable connections is shown below. Please note that **M5Camera and M5Stack should NOT be connected to the PC at the same time** since the 5V line is connected.
